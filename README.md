# SMS-Spam-Detection-End-to-End-Project
This SMS Spam Detection project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to classify text messages as spam or ham (not spam). The model preprocesses text by removing stopwords, punctuation, and converting text to lowercase. It then uses TF-IDF vectorization to transform text into numerical features, making it suitable for machine learning models like Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Random Forest.

The primary goal is to build an efficient spam filter to automate message classification, helping users avoid unwanted or fraudulent messages.
